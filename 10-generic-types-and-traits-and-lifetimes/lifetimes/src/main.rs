    - at compile time, Rust compiler compares the size of the two lifetimes and sees that 'r' has
    lifetime of 'a but that it refers to memory within a lifetime of 'b. The program is rejected
    because 'b is shorter than 'a: the subject of the reference doesn't live as long as the
    reference.

    /* Lifetime Ellision
        1. The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter thatâ€™s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter:

        fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32);

        a function with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters:

        fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32);

        and so on.


        2. The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters:

        fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.

        3. The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.
